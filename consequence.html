	<h1> Consequences of cyberbullying</h1> 
<h4> <em> Online bullying can be particularly damaging and upsetting because it's usually anonymous or hard to trace. It's also hard to control, and the person being victimized has no idea how many people (or hundreds of people) have seen the messages or posts. People can be tormented non stop whenever they check their device or computer. </em> </h4>



<div class="box5">
<p> Research shows many negative effects of cyberbullying, some of which can lead to severe mental health issues. Cyberbullied people are twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts, actions, or behaviors and engage in self-harm as those who are not.

Other negative health consequences of cyberbullying are:

<ul> <li>Depression</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Stomach pain and digestive issues</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances</li>
<li>Difficulties with academics</li>
<li>Violent behaviors</li>
<li>High levels of stress</li>
<li>Inability to feel safe</li>
<li>Feelings of loneliness and isolation</li>
<li>Feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness</li></ul> </p>

<p> Any type of bullying, in-person or online, can leave you feeling deeply distressed, scared, angry, or ashamed. It can take a heavy toll on your self-esteem and trigger mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. You may feel like you're alone and powerless to make the bullying stopâ€”or even that you're somehow responsible for being bullied.</p>

<h2>In many cases, though, cyberbullying can be even more painful than face-to-face bullying because:</h2>

<ul><li>Cyberbullying can happen anywhere, at any time. You may experience it even in places where you'd normally feel safe, such as your home, and at times when you'd least expect it, like during the weekend in the company of your family. It can seem like there's no escape from the taunting and humiliation.</li>

<li>A lot of cyberbullying can be done anonymously, so you may not be sure who is targeting you. This can make you feel even more threatened and can embolden bullies, as they believe online anonymity means they're less likely to get caught. Since cyberbullies can't see your reaction, they will often go much further in their harassment or ridicule than they would if they were face-to-face with you.</li>

<li>Cyberbullying can be witnessed by potentially thousands of people. Emails, messages, and tweets can be forwarded to many, many people while social media posts or website comments can often be seen by anyone. The more far-reaching the bullying, the more humiliating it can become.</li>

<li>Cyberbullying can often be permanent. Malicious lies or embarrassing images can often remain visible online indefinitely, having long-term consequences on your life, reputation, and well-being.</li></ul></p>
